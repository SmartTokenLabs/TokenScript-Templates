# TokenScript-Template ENS-1155

### Getting Started

To help with development of this template ensure you have ERC-1155 ENS tokens in your wallet.

Please update the Smart Contract definitions inside `tokenscript.xml` and `src/lib/abi.ts` to point to either Mainnet (chain id: 1) or Sepolia Testnet (chain id: 11155111).

When configured, next from within this directory run `npm run emulate` to start the application.
