# Svelte Project Template

## Development

### Exploring the project directory

- `/tokenscript.xml` defines project's the views, actions and props in correlation with the Svelte application. Each view should be defined inside the `TokenScript.xml` and within the Svelte application.

- `/App.svelte` is an entry point which new views can be added to the Svelte application. 

- `/src/routes/` contains example views `Mint` and `Info` which can be built upon or used as a reference towards your project.

- `/out/tokenscript.tsml` is the finalised project output. This is generated when you start or build this application. 

### Start 

`npm run start`

`npm run build`
